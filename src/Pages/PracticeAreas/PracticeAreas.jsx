          <h2>Business Law</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing the right type of business entity can save business owners
            money by lowering their taxes and reducing the complexity and cost
            of running the business. Generally, business owners must choose
            between a sole proprietorship, limited liability company,
            partnership, or corporation. Moreover, the business owner must
            choose how they want their business entity to be taxed: as a
            disregarded entity, partnership, S corporation, or C corporation.
            The right type of entity can have significant income tax and asset
            protection consequences. We can help business owners discuss the
            pros and cons of each entity type in terms of ease and cost of
            formation, control and management, liability protection, and federal
            income taxation issues. Please take a moment to explore our website
            and learn more about our services.
