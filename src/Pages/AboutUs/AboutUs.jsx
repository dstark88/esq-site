        Denny & Boulton, P.C. is committed to helping taxpayers resolve their
        IRS and Arizona state tax issues. Taxation is an overly complicated area
        of the law. That is why we limit our practice to only tax related
        matters. Doing so, we are able to stay current on the tax code and help
        secure the best possible outcome for our clients. We offer the services
        necessary to represent our clients from beginning to end no matter how
        simple or complicated their tax matter is.

        Maybe you are considering taking the first step towards becoming a
        business owner. We can help you consider the pros and cons of each
        business entity, whether your goal is to limit your liability or to
        reduce your taxes. We can discuss whether you should operate as a sole
        proprietor, partnership, limited liability company, S corp, or regular C
        corporation. We can also discuss the default taxation of each entity and
        when and how it might be beneficial to elect to be taxed as something
        else.

        Maybe it’s been a long time since you filed your tax returns (our record
        is 25 years) and you’re scared to file this year because the IRS is
        going to find out and take everything from you. Don’t be scared. We can
        request wage and income transcripts from the IRS to help prepare
        un-filed tax returns. We prepare un-filed tax returns and current year
        tax returns for individuals and businesses including partnerships
        (1065), S Corps (1120S) and Corporations (1120). We can advise business
        owners with employees of their employment tax obligations and filing
        requirements (941/940 for FICA/FUTA). We also prepare amended returns.

        Maybe you are being audited by the IRS or state taxing authority. We can
        help you through the audit process and make sure you are receiving the
        best possible outcome.

        Maybe the IRS has already attempted to collect from you and you’ve
        received a wage garnishment or a bank account levy. Or maybe the IRS has
        filed a tax lien against you and it is showing up on your personal
        credit report. You have options. We can negotiate the release of the
        garnishment, levy, or tax lien and discuss collection alternatives such
        as Offer in Compromise, Installment Agreement, Currently Not Collectible
        Status, and Bankruptcy. Each option provides you with reasonable living
        expenses so you are able to settle your tax liability on your terms
        while still being able to provide for yourself and your family.

        You might have a bank account overseas and your foreign bank is sending
        you letters about “FATCA.” We can discuss your reporting requirements
        including Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBARs). We can also discuss
        disclosing the foreign bank account or foreign security through the
        Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP) or the Streamlined Domestic
        Offshore Procedures.

        No matter where you are in the process, we can help! The first step (and
        often the most difficult) is picking up the phone to make that first
        call. We are here to help.
