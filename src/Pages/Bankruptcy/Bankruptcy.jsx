        A bankruptcy filing can help individuals and businesses discharge their
        unsecured debts and receive a fresh start. In addition, it can also
        resolve and re-prioritize their other debts in an equitable manner.
        However, the decision to file for bankruptcy should not be taken
        lightly. Careful evaluation of the financial affairs of the debtor and
        exemption planning are essential to maximizing the effect of the
        automatic stay and subsequent discharge.

        Such an evaluation is even more essential for an individual or business
        contemplating a “tax-motivated filing.” Specifically, in addition to the
        financial affairs and exemption planning that must take place prior to
        filing, a tax motivated client will need to understand the difference
        between nondischargeable, dischargeable, priority, non-priority, secured
        and unsecured tax debts, and will further need to know when and how such
        characteristics change for their benefit. This analysis will give the
        debtor an idea of what tax debts may remain post-discharge and
        ultimately, whether or not the bankruptcy filing is a worthy alternative
        to other viable options.
