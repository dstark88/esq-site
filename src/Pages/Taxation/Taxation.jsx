            <p>
              An OIC allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full
              amount you owe. It could be a legitimate option if you cannot pay
              your tax liability in full, or if paying in full would create a
              financial hardship. An OIC is based on your financial condition
              and ability to pay at time of submission and it must be
              accompanied by extensive documentation, including financial
              statements. The Offer amount can be paid in a lump sum, in
              installments, or a combination of the two.

            </h3>
            <p>
              If IRS determines that you cannot pay all or some of your tax debt
              due to an economic hardship, IRS may temporarily delay collection
              until your financial condition improves.

            <p>
              Paying in full, whether in a lump sum or over several months may
              prevent the filing of a tax lien or other enforced collection
              action, as long as you comply with the terms of your agreement.

            <h2 className="text-red-800 pb-6">Liens and Levies</h2>
            <p>
              A levy is a seizure of your property to satisfy a tax debt and will take property to satisfy the debt. A lien is a claim used as security for the tax debt.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Before IRS can take collection actions such as liens on real estate, seizure of property, levies, or garnishments, the IRS must issue to the taxpayer a “Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right To a Hearing,” allowing up to 30 days from the date of the Final Notice to pay the debt in full or to find another solution. A timely filed protest can stop the levy and allow us to try to resolve your case.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If your assets have been seized, it is important that you immediately contact competent counsel to timely and effectively defend your rights to appeal or protest.

            <p>
             Failure to disclose on an annual basis your foreign accounts, foreign assets and earnings is a violation of U.S. tax law that could be regarded as criminal in nature. There are extreme penalties for failing to properly report. We help individuals with foreign disclosure problems and assist them regarding the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative and completing the necessary, complicated forms (i.e., Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBARs).

            <p>
             You may not have responded to an earlier IRS notice and IRS may have assessed the liability based on certain assumptions. You may be able to ask the IRS to reconsider the assessment. Some acceptable reasons may include: you did not appear for an audit; you moved and did not receive the IRS correspondence; you submitted documents that were not considered; or you have new documentation to present.
