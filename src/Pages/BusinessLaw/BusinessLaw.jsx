        Complexity is the enemy of execution. Establishing and operating a business is stressful. Entity selection is an important but often overlooked first step. We help business owners with entity selection by first reviewing available business entities, including LLCs, Partnerships, Corporations, and S Corporations, and then advising business owners on which entity is best aligned with each ownerâ€™s particular goals, whether it be to reduce their exposure to liability or minimize their tax burden. We establish the business by filing the necessary documents with the Arizona Corporation Commission. We also prepare and file annual tax return(s) (1040, 1065, 1120, and 1120S).
